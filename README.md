# chessengines

Some bad UCI chess engines in python.

Inspired from [Elo World](http://tom7.org/chess/weak.pdf/) and the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/DpXy041BIlA).

## Engine list

Unless otherwise stated, ties are broken randomly.
This is generated by `scripts/showengines.py`!

[`random`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L18-22): Plays random moves.  
[`randomcheck`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L23-31): Plays random moves, prioritizing checks.  
[`randomcapture`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L32-40): Plays random moves, prioritizing captures.  
[`samepiece`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L41-52): Tries to move the same piece from the last move, playing a random move.  
[`copy`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L53-65): Tries to copy the opponents move.  
[`minimizeopponentmoves`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L66-81): Play the move that minimizes opponents legal moves.  
[`maximizeopponentmoves`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L82-97): Play the move that maximizes opponents legal moves.  
[`minimizeownmoves`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L98-114): Play the move that minimize its own legal moves if it was its turn again.  
[`maximizeownmoves`](https://github.com/RealCyGuy/chessengines/blob/main/engines.py#L115-131): Play the move that maximizes its own legal moves if it was its turn again.

## Running

I use poetry as a package manager, but you just need the [`chess`](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) package.

`engine.py` is a [Universal Chess Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) that can be used with chess GUIs.

You can choose an engine from the list above with the parameter `--engine <engine>` or use UCI's `setoption name Engine value <engine>`.
